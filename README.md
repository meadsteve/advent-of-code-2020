# Advent of code 2020 (in crystal lang)

These are my [Advent of code](https://adventofcode.com/2020) solutions for 2020. I wrote a short [blog post about setting up crystal](https://blog.meadsteve.dev/programming/2020/03/04/advent-of-crystal/) for this year's advent of code.

And a follow up blog on [some mistakes I made](https://blog.meadsteve.dev/programming/2020/03/04/advent-of-mistakes/).
